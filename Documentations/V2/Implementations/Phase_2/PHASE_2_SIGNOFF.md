# Phase 2 — Sign-Off

## Status
- [ ] Phase 2 items implemented per plan
- [ ] All design/implementation MDs created
- [ ] Local verification complete
- [ ] Sign-off approved

## Scope Covered
- **Phase 2**: Architectural Improvements
- 2.1: Validation & Normalization Layer Strategy (FormDataExtractor)
- 2.2: Standard Pattern for File Uploads (ProjectAttachmentHandler)
- 2.3: Standard Pattern for Numeric Calculations with Bounds (BoundedNumericService)
- 2.4: Multi-Step Form Data Ownership (FormSection / ownedKeys)
- 2.5: Role and Permission Management Contract (RoleGuard)

## What Is Explicitly NOT Included
- Items listed in "EXPLICITLY DEFERRED" (Phase_Wise_Refactor_Plan.md) until prerequisites are met
- ProjectController orchestration refactor before 1A.4 complete and FormSection designed
- Report/export flows before ProjectAttachmentHandler exists

## Known Risks Deferred
- Per Phase_Wise_Refactor_Plan.md "EXPLICITLY DEFERRED" section; each area has its own prerequisites.

## Deployment Statement
**Deployment has NOT yet occurred.** Phase 2 work is applied locally. Production deployment verification happens ONLY AFTER Phase 1A, Phase 1B, and Phase 2 sign-offs are complete per the Fix-First, Single-Deploy strategy.

## Prerequisite
Phase 1A Final Sign-off and Phase 1B Sign-off must be approved. "EXPLICITLY DEFERRED" prerequisites must be met for each Phase 2 target area.

## Date
- Sign-off: (pending)
