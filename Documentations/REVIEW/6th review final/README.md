## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Code Verification Status
- ✅ Most service classes exist and are properly implemented
- ✅ Helper functions exist and work correctly
- 🔄 Some controller methods need integration
- 🔄 Some view files need updates (varies by feature)

### Known Issues
- Some documented tasks may have been completed but not documented
- Some tasks may need re-verification as codebase evolves
- Time estimates are approximate and may vary

### Recommendations
1. **Start with quick wins** - Complete aggregated reports updates first (25 minutes)
2. **Focus on testing** - Testing coverage is currently low (~30%)
3. **Prioritize integration** - Several features have code complete but need integration
4. **Document as you go** - Update status documents as tasks are completed
